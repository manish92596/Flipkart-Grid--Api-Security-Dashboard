In this video, we provide a walkthrough of our API security dashboard and demonstrate how newly added APIs are detected in real-time.

In this video, we demonstrate how our dashboard detects new vulnerabilities if they exist in an API. We also explain the security score pie chart, which provides an overview of how much of the code is secure versus vulnerable. Additionally, we discuss the bar graph, which shows the distribution of different vulnerabilities and highlights those that pose the most risk, helping you quickly identify and prioritize areas that need immediate attention.

In this video, we demonstrate the CI/CD pipeline and regression testing of various vulnerability modules. We show how the test cases behave when a new vulnerability module is added, ensuring that any newly introduced vulnerabilities are identified and managed effectively. If all test cases pass, the deployment proceeds smoothly to AWS. However, if even one test case fails, the deployment is halted, preventing any potential security risks from reaching the production environment. This process ensures that only secure and thoroughly tested updates are deployed, maintaining the integrity and safety of your application.
